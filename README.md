My final Foundations project for The Odin Project!

This is my final project for the Foundations section in the Odin Project where I got to combine and practice everything I had learned so far about Git, HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and JavaScript. Additionally, I refined my debugging, problem-solving, and writing clean code skills.
