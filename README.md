My final Foundations project for The Odin Project!

This is my final project for the Foundations section in The Odin Project. I combined and practiced everything I had learned about Git, HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and JavaScript to create a calculator. In addition, I refined my debugging, problem-solving, and clean code-writing skills.
